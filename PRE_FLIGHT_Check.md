# Polymorph Pre-Flight Log

## PFC-2026-09-09-002 — Core conversion engine scaffold

- Target files: `src/polymorph/{constants,models,probe,geometry,filters,tools,converter}.py`, tests, `pyproject.toml`, tracking docs.
- Relevant history checked: `PROJECT_CONTRACT.md`, `MASTER.md`, `PRE_FLIGHT_Check.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/UX_SPEC.md`.
- Reference behavior checked: validated FFmpeg -> YUV4MPEG -> gifski behavior, including explicit source FPS handoff to prevent gifski's default 20 FPS resampling.
- Connected modules reviewed: WebP probe fallback, framing geometry, filter construction, tool discovery, size optimizer.
- Conflict risks: frame-rate resampling, variable-duration WebP timing loss, color/timing drift, false no-upscale guarantees, resolution optimizer silently degrading other quality dimensions.
- Recommended action: keep on `dev`; validate with known HeroForge WebPs before merge/release.

## PFC-2026-09-09-001 — Repository bootstrap

- Target files: repository contract, project status, changelog/pre-flight tracking, architecture/UX docs, third-party dependency notes.
- Existing project history checked: repository was empty; no prior Polymorph history existed.
- Reference behavior checked: previously validated WebP -> GIF pipeline requirements were recorded as canonical behavior.
- Connected modules reviewed: Witch Dock remains a separate project and was not modified.
- Conflict risks: accidentally coupling Polymorph to Witch Dock; failing to preserve the validated GIF pipeline; public binary distribution before dependency/license review.
- Recommended action: keep application development isolated on `dev` and publish only validated builds.
